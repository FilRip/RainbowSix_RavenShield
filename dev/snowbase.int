ID_MENUNAME=Snowbase
ID_CODENAME=Rogue Spear: Snowbase [By Raptor]
ID_DATETIME=2003.3.19 - 1300
ID_LOCATION=Northern Russia
ID_CONTROL=Prisoners taken from a previous Rainbow Op have alerted us about a secret hideaway for high profile terrorists.  Little is known as to which members of Rainbows most wanted are currently hiding out, but regardless, the base must be taken as soon as possible.  Intelligence also reported that there may be a significant weapons cache as well as various information regarding terrorist activities.
ID_CLARK=We need to shut down this 'safe house' for terrorists.  Perhaps it can flush some out into the open and Rainbow can make the world a safer place.  Just remember, we all come back.
ID_SWEENY=There are many unknowns to this mission so it should be considered an extremely threatening mission.  We dont know how many tangos there are, but I know Rainbow can handle it.  Good luck people.
ID_NEWSWIRE=The media has reported various disapearances of civillians last seen within the area.  Perhaps they got a little too close.
ID_MISSION_ORDER=Your mission is to neutralize all terrorists, and investigate civillian disappearance as well as seek information regarding terrorist whereabouts.
